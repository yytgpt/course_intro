<p>The course is lined towards understanding probability ideas in computer science. Apart from developing the subject the theoretical way, we address some of the most interesting real life questions and provide solutions to it. Following are some of the most interesting questions we address in the course:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the ideal and optimal “dating” strategy? 
Of what interest is this to computer scientists? </li>
<li>Can you convince a person that you know a secret without telling him/her the secret? This is doable and is one of the path breaking ideas in computer security!</li>
<li>Is it practical and advisable to claim “you’re feeling lucky” and gamble?  Why should one never visit Las Vegas? 
What has this to do with the mechanism with which internet search engines work?</li>
<li>Can ideas from probability theory help one design algorithms that can make your android phone beat the world’s fastest supercomputer?</li>
<li>Do we all have a common biological “ancestral mother” from whom everyone descended? Answer: YES and we need both - ideas from probability theory and computer science to answer this!
<br><br>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The course is mainly geared towards making students understand and appreciate the idea of probability and randomization in the field of computing. At the end of the course, the student will  be:</p>

<ul>
<li>confident of reading and understanding any probability related idea in computer science.</li>
<li>able to think on the lines of solving a problem with randomization techniques, which are otherwise hard to solve the deterministic way. </li>
<li>able to appreciate the basic ideas in probability such as distributions, bounds, inequalities and their applications.</li>
<li>to a good extent able to independently read and understand the technical details in a research paper that uses probability ideas to solve questions related to computer science. </li>
</ul>
